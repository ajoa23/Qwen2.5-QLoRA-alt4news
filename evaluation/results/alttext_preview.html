                <h3>Shopping for Outdoor Sconces</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> For a small light fixture, an exterior sconce can have an outsize effect on the way your home looks — especially as it gets dark earlier.</p>
                <p><strong>Caption:</strong> While a traditional home will often have two sconces on either side of the front door for symmetry, a modern home may need only one (the Atomic Industrial Guard Sconce, above, is $242 at Barn Light Electric Company).</p>

                <h3>A New Theory on How Neanderthal DNA Spread in Asia</h3>
                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Two teams of researchers have come to a conclusion about why the ancestors of Asians and Europeans have different amounts of Neanderthal DNA.</p>
                <p><strong>Caption:</strong> Chinese passengers wait on a train platform at the Beijing Railway Station. Researchers have discovered that Neanderthals interbred with the ancestors of Asians at two points in history, giving this population an extra infusion of Neanderthal DNA.</p>
